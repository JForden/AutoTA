Welcome to TA-Bot!

Sorry about the brevity of this ReadMe for now, but there will be more to come in the future. In the meantime, you can check out the current state of TA-Bot at http://tabot.sh.

:warning: Known Issue: There is currently a bug that prevents yarn from working in our Docker container.

:bulb: Workaround for Windows Users: To run the TA-Bot Docker development environment on Windows, you will need to install WSL2 (which is required for Docker) and a Linux environment of your choice (e.g. Ubuntu). Follow the steps at https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview to set this up. Then, follow the steps below to run TA-Bot.

:rocket: Steps to Running the TA-Bot Docker Development Environment:

1. Clone the repository.
2. In the main directory run "git submodule update --init --recursive"
3. Replace app.config['TABOT_PATH'] = with the path to the ta-bot folder ex: app.config['TABOT_PATH'] = {your path here}/AutoTA/ta-bot' 
2. Navigate to the /ui directory.
3. Run yarn install.
4. Download and install Docker.
Note for WSL Users: If you are using WSL, follow the instructions at https://medium.com/geekculture/run-docker-in-windows-10-11-wsl-without-docker-desktop-a2a7eb90556d to install Docker in your WSL environment.
Note for WSL Users: To enable port forwarding from the WSL environment to your localhost, follow the instructions at https://dev.to/vishnumohanrk/wsl-port-forwarding-2e22
Note: Make sure to edit the shell script to include 3000


5. Run docker compose up from the main directory.

The Development environment should now be up on localhost:3000




Thanks,
